# SoreEyes_HUD(Alpha)
This is an amateur attempt at creating my own HUD for an FPS Shooter.
=====================================================================

As the description  says, this is a personal attempt at creating a
HUD for the videogame Team Fortress 2.
This is NOT supposed to be a "better" HUD. I am solely creating this
because I am bored out of quarantine and because the default HUD in
this game is straining my eyes.
It is none of my desires for this HUD to become popular. I intend it
for personal use. However if anyone else finds interest in using it,
then be my guest and enjoy this HUD.

# How to install:
Put the folder containing the HUD into the following directory:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

Note: If you have installed TF2 onto a different drive, then use that
 drive. Tbh, I shouldn't even tell you that. The same applies if you
 have installed TF2 into a different directory.

IMPORTANT:
This HUD only works on a 16:9 resolution. I have yet to figure out,
how to use the "C" values for placement.

This is my very first time creating a HUD. I WILL make mistakes and
questionable choises.
